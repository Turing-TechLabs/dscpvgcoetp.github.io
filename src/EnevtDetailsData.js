        Android Study Jams are back!!
        <br />
        <br />
        Exciting opportunities awaits all Android lovers
        <br />
        <br />
        Google decided that Kotlin was its preferred language for building
        Android apps
        <br />
        <br />
        That's not the only reason to learn Kotlin!
        <br />
        <br />
        It is a modern, concise and safe programming language which is easy to
        pick up, so that you can create powerful applications immediately.
        <br />
        <br />
        Android is ubiquitous. Imagining a world without it is improbable. So is
        life without Android Apps!
        <br />
        <br />
        Kick start your journey as an Android Developer with GDSC PVGCOET.
        <br />
        <br />
        Learn how to build your first Android App to solve real world problems.
        <br />
        <br />
